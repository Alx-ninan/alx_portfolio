# Alex Ninan - Analytics Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Alex! I have a strong background in digital analytics with expertise in conversion rate optimisation and recently completed my MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Portsmouth. With over five years of experience in data-driven decision-making, I have developed expertise in leveraging analytics to enhance user experiences and business outcomes.

I deepened my knowledge of machine learning, big data applications, and intelligent data analytics during my studies. I enjoy solving complex problems using statistical analysis, programming, and data visualisation techniques. My professional experience includes working with tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau platforms to extract meaningful insights and optimise performance.

Currently, I work as a part-time retail assistant at Primark while continuing to expand my expertise in data science and analytics. I am passionate about exploring new technologies, refining my coding skills, and applying data-driven methodologies to real-world challenges.

This repository serves as a space to showcase my projects, share insights, and track my progress in data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.
